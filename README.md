# Special-Topics-MATH-UA-395

Special Topics was taken through the Courant Institute of Mathematics during the Fall semester of 2021. The course covered numerical methods and modeling with MatLab for scientific purposes. Taught by Professor Charles Peskin, more information on his class can be found [here](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~peskin/modsim_lecture_notes/index.html).

Projects for this class will have my code uploaded onto this repository. Write-ups and presentation material will be posted on my personal website [here](https://www.meiqibrook.com).
